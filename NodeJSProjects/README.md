# Sample NodeJS Project

## Introduction

This sample NodeJS project demonstrates two NodeJS usecases:
 
* Building command line programs
* Using NodeJS as an application / web server
* Using NodeJS as an API (Application Programming Interface) server

There are many other usecases NOT covered in this sample:

* NodeJS as a proxy server
* NodeJS as a communication server (i.e. using websockets)
* NodeBots and more!

### Installing NodeJS

Visit https://nodejs.org/ and install the latest version of NodeJS.
